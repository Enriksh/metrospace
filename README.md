The university mobile app is a convenient and efficient way for students, teachers, parents, and alumni to stay connected with their university community. It allows students to view announcements and notifications from university clubs they are a member of, chat with other members of those clubs, and access class schedules. Club administrators can post announcements and updates to club members, approve or deny new member requests. Alumni can register as an alumni on the app and view updates from their former clubs and connect with other alumni. Teachers can post announcements and updates to specific classes and view a list of students in a particular class. Parents can view announcements and updates from the university and specific clubs their child is a member of, as well as view their child's class schedule and contact their child's teacher if needed.
